Invariants
---------
- Looking at the right property is important in general
- Sometimes it is a number, sometimes it is something else
- The properties that do not change are called invariants

>Coffee with milk problem
- It might seem that some serious calculations are needed
- We don't know the sizes of cups and the size of the spoon
- Maybe the result depends on these parameters?

The size of a drink in Cup 1 is invariant!  
So the amount of coffee missing in Cup 1 is the same as the amount of milk added to Cup 1!
