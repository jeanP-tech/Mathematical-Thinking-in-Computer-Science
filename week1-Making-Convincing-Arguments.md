Existence Proofs
===========

One Example is Enough
--------

* what does the proof look like?
* it depends 
* claim: object with given properties exists
* proof: an example
* one example is enough

Know Your Rights
-----------

No rights for Teachers
* how did we find 7125?
* ab...z = 57 x b...z
* X = b...z has k digits
* a X 10^k = 56 x X = 7 x 8 x X
* a divisible by 7: only a = 7 works
* 10^k = 8 x X; 10 and 100 not multiples of 8
* 1000 works, X = 125

Nobody Can Win All The Time: Nonexisting Examples
-----------
Splitting Weights
* three weights: 1, 2, 3
* split into two groups
* 1 + 2 = 3
* +- 1 +- 2 +- 3 = 0
* + 1 + 2 - 3 = 0

Find a Splitting
* 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7 -> two groups of equal weight
* total weight: 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 7 = 22
* find a group of weight 11
* easy: 4 + 7

Obstacles
* if the weights are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6?
* total weight 21 : not a multiple of 2
* what about weights 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12?
* hint: just changing the units

Bad news
* 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 17 = 32
* sum is even, but...
* 17 is too big

Take-home Message
* the structure of the proof reflects the structure of the claim
* claim: an object with some property exists
* proof: an example
* one example is enough
* no need to disclose the sources
* beware: claim may be false!
