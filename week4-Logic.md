Examples, Counterexamples, Logic
==============

Examples
-----------

- Sometimes, just one example is enough
- If we want to prove that white horses exist...
- It is sufficient to show just one white horse

Counterexamples
---------
- Just one counterexample is sufficient to disprove a statement
- If we want to prove that all swans are white...
- Just one black swan is sufficient to disprove it
- However, it is often hard to find such counterexamples

Basic Logic Constructs
----------

Logical Operations
- Negation
- Logical AND
- Logical OR
- If-then

<h3>Negation</h3>
- Statement: all swans are white
- Negation: Not all swans are white. Or, there are swans that are not white.
  
- Statement: 4 = 2 +2
- Negation 4 =/= 2 +2

Negation is true if and olnly if the initial statements is wrong, and vice versa.

<h3>Logical And</h3>
>4 = 2 + 2 AND 4 = 2 * 2
The logical AND of two statement is true if and only if both statements are true.

<h3>Logical OR</h3>
>4 = 2 + 2 OR 5 = 2 + 2
The logical OR of two statements is true if and only if at least one of them is true. 

<h3>Negation of AND</h3>
Negation of AND is OR of negations: negation of "A AND B"is "Not A OR Not B". 

<h3>If-Then</h3>
Consider a promise: if there is an elephant in the refrigerator, then I'll give you 100 dollars.  
  
In general, phrase "If P, Then Q" is true whenever either Q is true or P is false.  

If-Then Generaliztion, Quantification
------------

"If n is divisible by 4, then n is divisible by 2" - direct statement  
"If n is divisible by 2, then n is divisible by 4" - converse statement.  
When both direct statement "If P, then Q" and converse statement "If Q, then P" are true, we write that they are equivalent like this: "P if and only if Q".

<h3>Negation of If-Then</h3>
The negation of the phrase "If P, Then Q" is "P and not Q". Check that it is true whenever the corresponding If-Then is false, and vice versa. 

<h3>Universal Quantification</h3>

Statements like
- All swans are white
- All integers ending with digit 2 are even
- For all n, 2n = n + n
are examples of universal quantification

<h3>Existential Quantification</h3>

Statements like
- There are black swans
- There is a way to get a change of 12 cents with 4cents and 5-cents cois
- There is a power of 2 starting with 65
are examples of existential quantification
